<h1>Story</h1><br>
"Prevention is better than cure" is one of the effective measures to prevent the spreading of COVID-19 and to protect mankind. Many researchers and doctors are working on medication and vaccination for corona.

COVID-19 spreads mostly by droplet infection when people cough or if we touch someone who is ill and then to our face (i.e rubbing eyes or nose). Ongoing pandemic shows that it is much more contagious and spreads fast. Depending on the infection spreading, we have two cases: Fast and Slow spread.

A fast pandemic will be terrible and will cost many lives. It occurs due to a rapid rate of infection because there are no countermeasures to slow it down. This is because, if the numbers of infected people get too large, healthcare systems become unable to handle it. We will lack resources such as medical staff or equipment like a ventilator.

To avoid the above situation, we need to do what we can to turn this into a slow pandemic. A pandemic can be slowed down only by the right responses, mainly in the early phase. In this phase, everyone who is sick can get treatment and there is no emergency point with flooded hospitals.

In this pandemic, we need to engineer our behavior as a vaccine. that is, "Not getting infected" and "Not infecting others". The best thing we can do is to wash our hands with soap or a hand sanitizer. The next best thing is social distancing.

To avoid getting infected or spreading it, It is essential to wear a face mask while going out from home especially to public places such as markets or hospitals.

<h1>About The Project</h1>

The system is designed to detect the faces and to determine whether the person wears a face mask or not. Using the above data, we can decide whether the concerned person can be allowed inside public places such as the market, or a hospital. This project can be used in the hospital, market, bus terminals, restaurants, and other public gatherings where the monitoring has to be done.
